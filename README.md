Makevention Registration System

Makevention (makevention.org) is a local Bloomington, IN maker event.

This project is a registration system for us to track groups and people who have attended and sponsored the event.

Since Bloominglabs, the B'ton hacker/makerspace is one of the primary organizing sponsors, this system is being created by some of its members.  http://bloominglabs.org/index.php/Makevention has more info on Bloominglabs' involvement in Makevention.
